# Brief Description:
The following files are included:
- `q1.py`: The python code for Q1
- `q2.py`: The python code for Q2
- `Q1_output.txt`: The file containing the output contents for q1.py
- `Q1_plot_1.png`: The file containing the plot of PCA
- `Q1_plot_2.png`: The file containing the plot of K vs normalised mutual information (NMI)
- `Q2_output.txt`: The file containing the output contents for q2.py
- `Q2_plot.png`: The file containing the plot of Learning Rate vs Accuracy for provided learning rates
- `Report.pdf`: The overall report containing all the details regarding the code implementation and the output results

# Directions to use the code  
1. Download this directory into your local machine

2. Copy the  `lung-cancer.csv` file in the Source Code Directory

3. Ensure all the necessary dependencies with required version and latest version of Python3 are available <br>
 `pip3 install -Iv numpy==1.23.2 matplotlib==3.5.3 pandas==1.4.3 scikit-learn==1.1.2`

# For running the python code for Question 1
- Run <br>
`python3 q1.py`
- The output would be saved to `Q1_output.txt` and the relevant plot of PCA `Q1_plot_1.png` and K vs NMI `Q1_plot_2.png` would be generated

# For running the python code for Question 2
- Run <br>
`python3 q2.py`
- The output would be saved to `Q2_output.txt` and the relevant plot of Learning Rate vs Accuracy `Q2_plot.png` would be generated
